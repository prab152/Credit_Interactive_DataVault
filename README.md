# **Credit Data Vault â€“ Interactive Knowledge Graph**  

## **Project Purpose**  
This project visualizes a **Data Vault Logical Data Model** for a bank's **credit domain** using an **interactive D3.js force-directed graph**. The model includes:  

- **Hubs** representing core business entities (e.g., Customers, Loans, Products).  
- **Satellites** storing descriptive attributes for hubs.  
- **Links** defining relationships between hubs.  
- **Bucket of Keys** where necessary.  
- **Reference Data** like **Forex Data** and **Interest Rates**.  
- **Business Lines** like **SME Credit, Retail Mortgages, Rural Farmers, and Corporate Lending** across multiple geographies.  

The graph is interactive, allowing users to explore relationships and click on nodes to view **detailed metadata** in a structured table format.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **D3.js** â€“ For interactive graph visualization.  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** â€“ For structuring and styling the web page.  
- **JSON** â€“ For storing nodes, links, and metadata configurations.  
- **GitHub Pages** â€“ For hosting the project.

## **Development Approach**  
This entire project was **built with ChatGPT's assistance**. Not a single line of code was written manually.  

### **Prompts Used**  
This project was iteratively refined using the following prompts (summarized):  

1. **Initial Graph Creation:**  
   - _"Create a D3.js force-directed graph to visualize a knowledge graph with labeled edges and dynamic interactions."_  

2. **Extending Nodes & Relationships:**  
   - _"Update the model to include hubs, satellites, links, business lines, geographies, reference data, and bucket keys."_  

3. **Adding Clickable Nodes:**  
   - _"Make a node clickable to display metadata details, including column names and data types."_  

4. **Fixing Colors & Labels:**  
   - _"Ensure each node's color is correctly applied from nodes-links.json and display relationship labels."_  

5. **Enhancing Pop-ups:**  
   - _"Format the pop-up details as a structured table with two columns: column name and data type."_  

6. **Debugging Issues:**  
   - _"Fix errors such as 'clickableNodes.includes is not a function' and ensure pop-ups work correctly."_  

7. **GitHub Integration:**  
   - _"Help me host this project using GitHub Pages under my repository 'Credit_Interactive_DataVault'."_
